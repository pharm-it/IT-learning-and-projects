# the following is a method to create a domain with Oracle virtualbox

2-create the virtual machines (i used oracle virtualbox)
3-after creation and installation is complete go to machines settings - network - use internal network
and create a name for the internal network eg pharmitnet
4-for the server VM use a static ip, and use the dns server ip as the server ip
5-for the windows vm use a static ip, and the DNS ip is the same as the server ip
6-the machines should be able to ping each other now


on the server side:
